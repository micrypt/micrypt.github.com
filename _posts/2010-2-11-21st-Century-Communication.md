I find it a bit amusing how many means of communication there are these days. I'm old enough to remember a period where the primary means of reaching anybody, apart from one's immediate neighbours, was the solitary home phone. However, these days there are so many ways of reaching people in remote areas of the world at strange times. It makes one wonder how the human race has adapted for these differences in such a short span of time. As a quick catalogue of the services I currently actively use {Facebook, Twitter, 3 E-mail addresses, Yahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, Skype, IRC and 1 mobile phone} It's no wonder my sleeping habits are borderline non-existent.
