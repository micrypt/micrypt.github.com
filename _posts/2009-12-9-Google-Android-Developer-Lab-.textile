I spent yesterday at Google London attending the Android Developer Lab. There're some really awesome devices on the Android platform (Motorola Droid!!!). I had a great day overall meeting some really bright people who are clearly passionate about building great applications. About 6 hours of fun with the Android 2.0 SDK and some multi-device testing.  It's a great time to be in the mobile applications space.  :)

PS: I'm definitely picking up the Motorola Milestone when it finally gets a UK carrier (Wake up O2!) .
