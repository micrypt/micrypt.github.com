summary: An exploration into what I mean when I call myself an artist.
---

bq. What is your purpose in life? What is the mission that you are one? Art should inspire, should change lives, should help people. If you start to call yourself an artist, you always have remember that that's the mission you've taken on. And, if this is a mission you've taken on, how much are you willing to invest your mind, your time, your being, your everything. - Sam Adoquei
